Abstract

This project pertains to developing the Object oriented application to enable configure network devices. The application allows administrator to store the various protocol specific configuration operations on a backend device. The application follows plugin-play design - that is, for new module or protocol, the developer needs to register the new set of configuration supported by the protocol with minimal code changes. Focus was to harness the OOPs design concepts to make the application open for extension but closed for modification. In addition, the application provides the WEB interface support to manipulate the network device configuration using REST API developed from scratch in C++. The CLI interface is not yet present to interact with the backend device. It is a future scope.
